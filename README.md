A simple Rails blog (web application) inspired by the [Ruby-on-Rails Get-started Tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

It illustrates:

- How to install Rails, create a new Rails application, and connect your application to a database (SQLite3).
- The general layout of a Rails application (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- The basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design.
- How to quickly generate the starting pieces of a Rails application.
